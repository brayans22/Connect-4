# Connect 4 Game

Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game where the goal is to align four discs of your color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a grid. This is a simple implementation of the game using structured programming in Java.

- **Grid**: 7 columns and 6 rows
- **Discs**: Each player has discs of different colors (commonly red and yellow)
- **Winning Condition**: The first player to align four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- **Gameplay**: Players take turns to drop their discs into one of the columns.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
